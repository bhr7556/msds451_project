The documents in this repository are for the term project MSDS451. 

Checkpoint A:
Nothing to note here. No analysis was performed and no code was produced.

Checkpoint B:
There are three files to this assignment: an html, ipynb, and a pdf. The hmtl is the from jupyter notebook containg the code and output generated. The ipynb files in the raw code used in case others want to download it. The pdf goes over the findings from the html analysis.
Chat gpt was used to generate code for the different concepts talked about in the prompt/assignment. 

Checkpoint C:
There are three files to this assignment: an html, ipynb, and a pdf. The hmtl is the from jupyter notebook containg the code and output generated. The ipynb files in the raw code used in case others want to download it. The pdf goes over the findings from the html analysis.
Chat gpt was used to generate code for the different concepts talked about in the prompt/assignment. Much of the code will look the same but Checkpoint C adds info on strategy evaluation, risk-adjusted metrics, fee modeling, and business insight

Term Project Report (CPF):

Chat gpt was used to generate code for the different concepts talked about in the prompt/assignment. The code was built upon checkpoints B and C but makes a reccommendation regarding the fund
